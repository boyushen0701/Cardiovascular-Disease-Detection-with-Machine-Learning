# Cardiovascular-Disease-Detection-with-Machine-Learning

Developed classification models with logistic regression, Knn, decision tree, to predict the probability of getting cardiovascular disease by using
13 basic physical features such as weight, height etc. ;
Optimized hyperparameter settings using Cross Validation and Grid Search based on evaluation metrics like confusion matrix;
Improved the accuracy of cardiovascular disease detection by 10% from the most recent result;
